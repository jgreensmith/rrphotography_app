# Rebecca Reynolds Photography

NEXTJS. The app has been converted from create-react-app to nextjs. \ 
the app uses sanity as a headless CMS and is deployed using vercel. \
The app contains a blog, contact, about, gallery and home page. \
It is for a professional photographer so i had to deal with very high quality images.
